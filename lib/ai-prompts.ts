Structure: {"filters": {"city": "Athens" or null, "country": "Greece" or null, "area": "Nea Smirni" or null, "listingtype": "Rent" or "Buy" or null, "minPrice": 400 or null, "maxPrice": 600 or null, "minBedrooms": 2 or null, "maxBedrooms": 3 or null, "minSize": 50 or null, "maxSize": 100 or null, "parking": true or false or null, "parkingSoftPreference": true or false or null, "heatingCategory": "central" or "autonomous" or null, "heatingAgent": "natural gas" or "oil" or "electricity" or null, "minFloor": 1 or null, "maxFloor": 5 or null, "minYearBuilt": 2000 or null, "maxYearBuilt": 2020 or null, "minYearRenovated": 2010 or null, "maxYearRenovated": 2023 or null, "minBathrooms": 1 or null, "maxBathrooms": 3 or null, "Metro": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "Bus": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "School": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "Hospital": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "Park": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "University": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Avoid" or "Not mentioned", "Safety": "Essential" or "Strong" or "Not important" or "Not mentioned", "preferredAreas": ["Filothei", "Psychiko"] or null, "vibePreference": "coastal" or "urban" or "family-friendly" or null}}

RULES:
- HARD FILTERS (filter DB): city, country, area, listingType, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, size, parking (unless soft preference), floor, yearBuilt, yearRenovated
- SOFT FILTERS (scoring only): distance categories, preferredAreas, heatingCategory, heatingAgent, parking (if soft preference)
- CRITICAL: Only extract explicitly mentioned values. Do NOT infer. "heating" alone → heatingCategory: null, heatingAgent: null
- Soft preference phrases: "not a deal breaker", "not that important", "nice to have", "would be good but not essential" → set parkingSoftPreference: true
- Location: Convert Greek to English ("Αθήνα" → "Athens"). Hard filter area: "in X" → area: "X". Preferred areas: "like X, Y" → area: null, preferredAreas: ["X", "Y"]
- Numbers: Price without qualifiers (e.g., "I want a house for 500") → maxPrice: 500 (treat as maximum)
- Bedrooms/Bathrooms: Fixed number without qualifier (e.g., "2 bedrooms", "two rooms", "2 bathrooms") → minBedrooms: 2, maxBedrooms: null (exact number). "at most X bedrooms" → minBedrooms: null, maxBedrooms: X. "at least X bedrooms" → minBedrooms: X, maxBedrooms: null. "exactly X bedrooms" → minBedrooms: X, maxBedrooms: X. Same logic applies to bathrooms
- Other numbers without qualifiers → assume "at least" (set min, max: null)
- Distance categories: Essential/Strong/Not important/Avoid. Reflect user's stated importance. "not essential" → Strong (not Essential). Unmentioned → "Not mentioned"
- Hospital category: Essential ONLY if explicitly asked for (e.g., "near hospital", "close to hospital"). Strong if user mentions they are or have people in need/elders/elderly/seniors/disabled/vulnerable/medical needs. Otherwise → "Not mentioned"
- Public transport rules:
  * "public transport" or "public transportation" or "move easily" or "easy to move" or "accessibility" → Metro: Essential, Bus: Essential (Metro has higher priority)
  * "near bus station" or "close to bus" or "bus access" → Bus: Essential (higher priority)
  * "near metro station" or "close to metro" or "metro access" → Metro: Essential (higher priority)
- Park category: Essential if user mentions pet/dog/cat/animal OR explicitly wants park. Strong if mentions park would be nice. Unmentioned → "Not mentioned"
- Safety category: Essential if user explicitly wants safe area OR mentions kids/children OR person in need OR elderly. Strong if mentions safety would be nice but not in explicit ways above. Not important if not mentioned. Unmentioned → "Not mentioned"
- Vibe preference: Extract 1-2 words describing the vibe/atmosphere the user wants. Examples: "near the beach" → "coastal", "city center" → "urban", "for kids" → "family-friendly", "quiet" → "quiet", "upscale" → "upscale". If no vibe mentioned → null`
